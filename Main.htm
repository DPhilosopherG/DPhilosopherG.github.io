    Greetings fellow intellectuals, my name is Darius.
            <p>
            I am a modern philosopher, and I will help you evolve as a human being and improve your life significantly through deep analyzation and contemplation. I specialize in modern interpretations of ancient philosophical teachings, and some often occurences in my works are actionable or practical steps.
                <br>
                <br>
            I am a young man trying to make sense of this world by asking the right questions, such as "Why?" Everything has an explanation, if you think about it just enough. I study philosophies like Existentialism, Stoicism, and Individualism, but I also reinterpret the works of ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle, Socrates, and Plato.
                <br>
                <br>
            Philosophy is all about understanding that you do not really understand anything, and then turning that into unlimited motivation.
                <br>
                <br>
            Evolve, one thought at a time.

    This is my best work available at the moment.
            <p>
            In order to give you the most value, I must write and think relentlessly. This work cannot always be synthesized into short posts or quotes, so I am offering you the only philosophical newsletter you will ever need.
                <br>
                <br>
            In this way, I always have contact with you - the reader - in case anything happens to my platforms. What I preach can be deemed as dangerous at any moment. Remember that our modern society does not want you to deconstruct their ways of running the world. They know that their ways are malicious.
                <br>
                <br>
            Malevolence is everywhere in the world, and I am here to fight it by spreading the objective truth and helping you become a critical thinker capable of shutting down any unnecessary beliefs.
                <br>
                <br>
            Free your mind through better thoughts.
        </p>
