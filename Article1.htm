<h1>The Desire To Know</h1>
    <p>- And why it is crucial for existence</p>
    <img src="Articles/ArtBanner1.jpg">
        
        <p>There are two types of people:
<br>
<br>
1) The one who is obliged to understand
<br>
<br>
The first type is the one who always feels obligated to learn, and therefore never actually makes any progress on his intellectual journey, being perfectly content with his ignorant bliss. This person is the usual scholar who goes to school for the sake of going, instead of taking the gathering of knowledge seriously.
<br>
<br>
2) The one who desires true understanding
            <br>
<br>
The second type is the one who learns independently and is motivated by a desire deep-down, urging him to discover. This person is the one who will achieve great things in life, because he or she is capable enough to push himself or herself towards greatness. Additionally, this is the person who truly desires to know.</p>
        <img src="files/PostDivider.png">
       <p> Why is the desire to know important?
<br>
<br>
This desire, which is fully original to human beings, has also been named “curiosity”, and serves as one of the primary attributes of very young children, for great reasons such as the fact that curiosity is the main factor of a developing society.
<br>
<br>
The brightest innovators throughout history WANTED to create and find new concepts, because nothing can simply be discovered without an innate desire inside of the person to be the creator of a new invention.
<br>
<br>
  From those two statements we can observe a synonymity between children and curiosity, both being the building blocks for the future. More clearly, for one thing to be of importance, it must serve a great purpose for the future, a criteria which curiosity easily meets. </p>
          <img src="files/PostDivider.png">
       <p> How can you develop your desire to know?
<br>
<br>
Developing your curiosity is quite a paradoxical endeavor. To be able to develop this part of your way of being, you must have been born as an obliged learner, in order to have areas that must be manually improved, instead of ones that have been inherited. But, wanting to improve at something is intrinsically a journey somewhat driven by the desire to know.
<br>
<br>
           Therefore, you can - to a degree - say that we are all subconsciously independent learners, some more than others, and some only regarding topics of personal interest, but all nevertheless. </p>
