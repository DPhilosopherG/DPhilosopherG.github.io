<p> The most important lesson that I have ever been taught is the following:
<br>
<br>
"A man that lacks purpose distracts himself with pleasure."
<br>
<br>
Don't give in to the temptations that modern society offers you.
<br>
<br>
Find your purpose. Stay focused. </p>

<p> Power is what drives men to do great things.
<br>
<br>
Yet power is becoming a scarcity.
<br>
<br>
People are weak.
<br>
<br>
They think in groups.
<br>
<br>
I recently finished reading The 48 Laws Of Power by Robert Greene.
<br>
<br>
One thing I've learnt is:
<br>
<br>
Envy and resentment will eat you alive if you let them spread.
<br>
<br>
Envy and resentment come from weak-minded friends.
<br>
<br>
Why are you surrounding yourself with losers?
<br>
<br>
Choose acquaintances with utmost cautiousness. </p>

<p> You are mediocre because that's all you deserve.
<br>
<br>
It means that you're content.
<br>
<br>
Your situation won't improve by ignoring it.
<br>
<br>
Only hard work elevates your existence.
<br>
<br>
Calculations are required.
<br>
<br>
Rockets don't just end up on the moon.
<br>
<br>
Think Bigger. Do better. </p>

<p> Knowledge runs the world.
<br>
<br>
Those at the top are the definition of wit.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, they mask real intelligence with the nonsense taught in schools.
<br>
<br>
I say that as a student with exceptional grades and a responsible attitude towards school.
<br>
<br>
It is all a lie. Books hold the power. </p>

<p> Effortlessness should radiate around you.
<br>
<br>
The one that tries too hard is despised.
<br>
<br>
You know he could easily surpass you because of his determination.
<br>
<br>
That makes him a threat.
<br>
<br>
Threats need to be neutralized.
<br>
<br>
Don't become a threat to someone.
<br>
<br>
Play the game from every team. </p>

<p> Your mind is your most powerful asset.
<br>
<br>
Don't waste it by believing garbage that doesn't help you.
<br>
<br>
Control your mind.
<br>
<br>
Use it to your advantage,
<br>
<br>
for it is the only thing you can control.
<br>
<br>
For those reasons: depression is irrational. </p>
