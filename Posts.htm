<p> The most important lesson that I have ever been taught is the following:
<br>
<br>
"A man that lacks purpose distracts himself with pleasure."
<br>
<br>
Don't give in to the temptations that modern society offers you.
<br>
<br>
Find your purpose. Stay focused. </p>

<p> Power is what drives men to do great things.
<br>
<br>
Yet power is becoming a scarcity.
<br>
<br>
People are weak.
<br>
<br>
They think in groups.
<br>
<br>
I recently finished reading The 48 Laws Of Power by Robert Greene.
<br>
<br>
One thing I've learnt is:
<br>
<br>
Envy and resentment will eat you alive if you let them spread.
<br>
<br>
Envy and resentment come from weak-minded friends.
<br>
<br>
Why are you surrounding yourself with losers?
<br>
<br>
Choose acquaintances with utmost cautiousness. </p>

<p> You are mediocre because that's all you deserve.
<br>
<br>
It means that you're content.
<br>
<br>
Your situation won't improve by ignoring it.
<br>
<br>
Only hard work elevates your existence.
<br>
<br>
Calculations are required.
<br>
<br>
Rockets don't just end up on the moon.
<br>
<br>
Think Bigger. Do better. </p>

<p> Knowledge runs the world.
<br>
<br>
Those at the top are the definition of wit.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, they mask real intelligence with the nonsense taught in schools.
<br>
<br>
I say that as a student with exceptional grades and a responsible attitude towards school.
<br>
<br>
It is all a lie. Books hold the power. </p>

<p> Effortlessness should radiate around you.
<br>
<br>
The one that tries too hard is despised.
<br>
<br>
You know he could easily surpass you because of his determination.
<br>
<br>
That makes him a threat.
<br>
<br>
Threats need to be neutralized.
<br>
<br>
Don't become a threat to someone.
<br>
<br>
Play the game from every team. </p>

<p> Your mind is your most powerful asset.
<br>
<br>
Don't waste it by believing garbage that doesn't help you.
<br>
<br>
Control your mind.
<br>
<br>
Use it to your advantage,
<br>
<br>
for it is the only thing you can control.
<br>
<br>
For those reasons: depression is irrational. </p>

<p> Recent and future inventions have been and will be made with the soul purpose of promoting weakness.
<br>
<br>
The light bulb was invented in 1879.
<br>
<br>
It was invented to improve our life. It's great.
<br>
<br>
Some might argue that even the smartphone is relatively useful, even with its downsides.
<br>
<br>
With that said, you can see that inventions are going from:
<br>
<br>
"We need this." to "We want this."
<br>
<br>
Which is not good, for multiple reasons.
<br>
<br>
It makes life too simple.
<br>
<br>
You need to suffer.
<br>
<br>
I'm an advocate for efficiency.
<br>
<br>
But this is not the way. It is a lie. </p>

<p> You keep hearing the same clich√®s for good reasons.
<br>
<br>
They are true.
<br>
<br>
Example: "Failure is necessary."
<br>
<br>
Your biggest idols are bigger failures than you.
<br>
<br>
Because they actually try.
<br>
<br>
Don't just sit there. Pursue your goals.
<br>
<br>
Failure teaches lessons.
<br>
<br>
Success comes from failure. </p>

<p> Self improvement can be challenging sometimes.
<br>
<br>
Here are 3 thoughts to remember when you're struggling:
<br>
<br>
1. God is always watching.
<br>
<br>
2. What will your future kids think of you if you don't succeed?
<br>
<br>
3. It's your duty as a man to do the hard work, regardless of how you feel. </p>

<p> Discipline is the most masculine trait.
<br>
<br>
Disciplined men go into the world and work as hard as possible,
<br>
<br>
even when they don't "feel like it".
<br>
<br>
That's what you should strive for.
<br>
<br>
Motivation is for your dreams. 
<br>
<br>
Discipline is for your goals.
<br>
<br>
Discipline is what keeps you going. </p>

<p> Congratulations to Hamza for hitting 2M subscribers!
<br>
<br>
He is my biggest idol in the present moment.
<br>
<br>
His advice is so transparent and unapologetically real.
<br>
<br>
We need more free-thinking men.
<br>
<br>
Strive to be like Adonis.
<br>
<br>
Do the hard work, especially when you don't feel like it. </p>

<p> People talk about how Andrew Tate spreads misogyny.
<br>
<br>
If you are an independent thinker, you can easily see through the lies.
<br>
<br>
I watch the Tate brothers.
<br>
<br>
Am I a misogynist?
<br>
<br>
Absolutely not.
<br>
<br>
I respect women MORE since I've started watching the Tates.
<br>
<br>
Counter that. </p>

<p> Has your mind ever been free?
<br>
<br>
I don't think so.
<br>
<br>
Your brain is clouded by unnecessary thoughts, urges and desires.
<br>
<br>
You need to open your mind in order to focus, and be fully present in your life.
<br>
<br>
Meditation is the key to that.
<br>
<br>
Just focus on your breath, relax, and enjoy. </p>

<p> Do you stand for something?
<br>
<br>
Do you have opinions that are your own?
<br>
<br>
Ask yourself those two questions and the answers will reveal themselves.
<br>
<br>
In this Godless and brainless society that we live in,
<br>
<br>
It's crucial to think for ourselves and not let the media indoctrinate us.
<br>
<br>
Ideology is the curse of our society,
<br>
<br>
Because it just makes everyone identical.
<br>
<br>
You don't need a community full of brainless ideologues - Individualism is the way.
<br>
<br>
Be a critical and independent thinker.
<br>
<br>
Either way, the concepts that ideology presents make you miserable. </p>

<p> The most dangerous trait a young man can possess is being articulate.
<br>
<br>
By being well-spoken, you can intimidate your enemies with powerful arguments.
<br>
<br>
Being defeated by words is humiliating.
<br>
<br>
It shows that you're incapable of holding your own ground.
<br>
<br>
Craft your words carefully.
<br>
<br>
And after all, what's your alternative?
<br>
<br>
Do you want to be inarticulate, and be unable to express your thoughts?
<br>
<br>
How is anyone going to take your ideas seriously if you can't communicate them?
<br>
<br>
Being articulate and cautious about your words is how you excite people. </p>
