<p> The most important lesson that I have ever been taught is the following:
<br>
<br>
"A man that lacks purpose distracts himself with pleasure."
<br>
<br>
Don't give in to the temptations that modern society offers you.
<br>
<br>
Find your purpose. Stay focused. </p>

<p> Power is what drives men to do great things.
<br>
<br>
Yet power is becoming a scarcity.
<br>
<br>
People are weak.
<br>
<br>
They think in groups.
<br>
<br>
I recently finished reading The 48 Laws Of Power by Robert Greene.
<br>
<br>
One thing I've learnt is:
<br>
<br>
Envy and resentment will eat you alive if you let them spread.
<br>
<br>
Envy and resentment come from weak-minded friends.
<br>
<br>
Why are you surrounding yourself with losers?
<br>
<br>
Choose acquaintances with utmost cautiousness. </p>

It means that you're content.

Your situation won't improve by ignoring it.

<br>
Only hard work elevates your existence.
<br>
<br>
Calculations are required.

Rockets don't just end up on the moon.

The one that tries too hard is despised.

<p> Recent and future inventions have been and will be made with the soul purpose of promoting weakness.
<br>
<br>
The light bulb was invented in 1879.
<br>
<br>
It was invented to improve our life. It's great.
<br>
<br>
Some might argue that even the smartphone is relatively useful, even with its downsides.
<br>
<br>
With that said, you can see that inventions are going from:
<br>
<br>
"We need this." to "We want this."
<br>
<br>
Which is not good, for multiple reasons.
<br>
<br>
It makes life too simple.

You need to suffer.

<p> You keep hearing the same clich√®s for good reasons.
<br>

They are true.

<br>
Your biggest idols are bigger failures than you.
<br>

Because they actually try.
<br>
<br>
Don't just sit there. Pursue your goals.

Failure teaches lessons.

<p> Self improvement can be challenging sometimes.
<br>
<br>
Here are 3 thoughts to remember when you're struggling:
<br>
<br>
1. God is always watching.
<br>
<br>
2. What will your future kids think of you if you don't succeed?
<br>
<br>
3. It's your duty as a man to do the hard work, regardless of how you feel. </p>

That's what you should strive for.

<p> Has your mind ever been free?
<br>
<br>
I don't think so.
<br>
<br>
Your brain is clouded by unnecessary thoughts, urges and desires.
<br>
<br>
You need to open your mind in order to focus, and be fully present in your life.
<br>
<br>
Meditation is the key to that.

Do you have opinions that are your own?

Ask yourself those two questions and the answers will reveal themselves.

In this Godless and brainless society that we live in,
<br>
<br>
It's crucial to think for ourselves and not let the media indoctrinate us.
<br>
<br>
Ideology is the curse of our society,

You don't need a community full of brainless ideologues - Individualism is the way.

<p> The most dangerous trait a young man can possess is being articulate.

By being well-spoken, you can intimidate your enemies with powerful arguments.

Being defeated by words is humiliating.

It shows that you're incapable of holding your own ground.
<br>
<br>
Craft your words carefully.

<p> I recently finished reading 12 Rules For Life by Jordan B. Peterson,
<br>
<br>
And it's been an enlightening experience.
<br>
<br>
Rule 8: Tell the truth ‚Äì or, at least, don't lie.
<br>
<br>
When in doubt, create no doubt with your sentences.
<br>
<br>
It's relieving to remain truthful during earnest situations.
<br>
<br>
The truth is very sustainable, because it's true.
<br>
<br>
Never be scared of what is true.
<br>
<br>
Be the pillar of reason and honesty.
<br>
<br>
And remember:
<br>
<br>
When cornered, never dig a hole in the wall.
<br>
<br>
This book is a hopeful one at that, it's truly your antidote to chaos.
<br>
<br>
Rule 1 says it all: Stand up straight with your shoulders back.
<br>
<br>
Confidence is needed when you want to become an advocate for honesty and honor.
<br>
<br>
Organize your life diligently and become a virtuous person. </p>

<p> People will tell you: "Oh, it's okay take a break."
<br>
<br>
No, it's not. Stop procrastinating.
<br>
<br>
Those people want you to stay weak.
<br>
<br>
I always tell procrastinators: "Slap yourself 3 times."
<br>
<br>
It works like a charm for me-A little wake-up call.
<br>
<br>
Ignoring responsibilities is the worst. </p>

<p> Some of you are too involved in problems that don't affect you.
<br>
<br>
Sure, have an opinion, and never accept propaganda as thoughts,
<br>
<br>
But your mind is too occupied with the actual "issue",
<br>
<br>
Instead of being occupied with how you're managing yourself in situations involving it.
<br>
<br>
The modern society is trying to take away your most important currency:
<br>
<br>
Your attention, which directly affects how your time gets spent.
<br>
<br>
Be one step ahead, and always focus on yourself. </p>

<p> If 2 quality books give the same piece of advice, it's usually important...
<br>
<br>
For example, "The 48 Laws Of Power" and "How To Win Friends And Influence People"
<br>
<br>
Both of these books preach to never argue, because arguments lead to nowhere.
<br>
<br>
Instead, Robert Greene advises you to speak louder through your actions,
<br>
<br>
While, Dale Carnegie advises you that a person's good will is much more important than showing your superiority.
<br>
<br>
People firmly cling to their beliefs, regardless of evidence, so you can't win an argument.</p>

<p> Do you know why school is an utter joke?
<br>
<br>
Because you can't rely on it anymore.
<br>
<br>
The whole point of the school is preparing you for the future.
<br>
<br>
I don't see that in their 150 year old teaching style.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, you cannot trust the fact that it won't crumble to pieces.
<br>
<br>
Teachers don't even care about schools anymore.
<br>
<br>
And for good reasons: the respect for teachers is so trivial to the point of irrelevance.
<br>
<br>
So how the fuck are you going to base your future off of that?
<br>
<br>
You have to pave your own road in life.
<br>
<br>
Study non-fictional literature.</p>

<p> You've heard that first impressions are important,
<br>
<br>
But have you ever heard about the importance of last impressions?
<br>
<br>
People sometimes part ways.
<br>
<br>
The best way to handle it is with professionalism.
<br>
<br>
Don't argue, don't try to seem superior.
<br>
<br>
Just leave. Avoid making new foes. </p>

<p> Psychologically speaking, the deepest desire of humans is the desire to feel important.
<br>
<br>
He who can fulfill this desire, will himself be the most important.
<br>
<br>
This feeling is tied to one's ego, so do not undermine anyone's pride,
<br>
<br>
As it is an attack on their core way of being.
<br>
<br>
This desire to be important is also partly the reason why the disgusting so-called "woke ideology" exists.
<br>
<br>
People today invent countless labels to feel special due to chronic lack of importance.
<br>
<br>
It's sad how people prioritize self-proclaimed importance over genuine value. </p>

<p> Here are the 3 steps to success:
<br>
<br>
1) Visualize your success - It feels amazing doesn't it?
<br>
<br>
2) Work hard - Maybe even fake success a little.
<br>
<br>
3) Actualize your success - It was about time!
<br>
<br>
Remember: Success is just a mentality you need to adopt.
<br>
<br>
Think success to achieve it! </p>

<p> Be kind and accepting of people.
<br>
<br>
That's one simple piece of advice I'd give to everyone.
<br>
<br>
The world is a beautiful place - Full of opportunities.
<br>
<br>
If someone doesn't share your way of thinking,
<br>
<br>
Learn to coexist. They're still humans.
<br>
<br>
Focus on improving yourself, and be better. </p>

<p> This might be the one good habit you're sleeping on:
<br>
<br>
Running. Just go out for a run.
<br>
<br>
It's very relaxing and you can enjoy nature - Just don't use headphones.
<br>
<br>
It builds discipline, and it gets you outside more - Win-win!
<br>
<br>
I recently discovered this, it's really useful! </p>

<p> Your mind and your brain are not the same thing.
<br>
<br>
Your brain is the physical vital organ responsible for the functioning of the body,
<br>
<br>
While your mind is the metaphysical consciousness responsible for thinking.
<br>
<br>
They have very different definitions, so why would they be the same?
<br>
<br>
By glancing at the definition of the brain,
<br>
<br>
It's clear why the brain can't be trusted with decision making.
<br>
<br>
Your brain causes addictions, it's the root of your problems.
<br>
<br>
Your brain is what urges you to indulge in the bad habits.
<br>
<br>
You must adopt more of your mind's thinking. </p>
