<p> The most important lesson that I have ever been taught is the following:
<br>
<br>
"A man that lacks purpose distracts himself with pleasure."
<br>
<br>
Don't give in to the temptations that modern society offers you.
<br>
<br>
Find your purpose. Stay focused. </p>

<p> Power is what drives men to do great things.
<br>
<br>
Yet power is becoming a scarcity.
<br>
<br>
People are weak.
<br>
<br>
They think in groups.
<br>
<br>
I recently finished reading The 48 Laws Of Power by Robert Greene.
<br>
<br>
One thing I've learnt is:
<br>
<br>
Envy and resentment will eat you alive if you let them spread.
<br>
<br>
Envy and resentment come from weak-minded friends.
<br>
<br>
Why are you surrounding yourself with losers?
<br>
<br>
Choose acquaintances with utmost cautiousness. </p>

<p> Recent and future inventions have been and will be made with the soul purpose of promoting weakness.
<br>
<br>
The light bulb was invented in 1879.
<br>
<br>
It was invented to improve our life. It's great.
<br>
<br>
Some might argue that even the smartphone is relatively useful, even with its downsides.
<br>
<br>
With that said, you can see that inventions are going from:
<br>
<br>
"We need this." to "We want this."
<br>

<p> Self improvement can be challenging sometimes.
<br>
<br>
Here are 3 thoughts to remember when you're struggling:
<br>
<br>
1. God is always watching.
<br>
<br>
2. What will your future kids think of you if you don't succeed?
<br>
<br>
3. It's your duty as a man to do the hard work, regardless of how you feel. </p>

<p> Congratulations to Hamza for hitting 2M subscribers!
<br>
<br>
He is my biggest idol in the present moment.
<br>
<br>
His advice is so transparent and unapologetically real.
<br>
<br>
We need more free-thinking men.
<br>
<br>
Strive to be like Adonis.
<br>
<br>
Do the hard work, especially when you don't feel like it.
<br>
<br>
In a world where it is very rare to find real idols,
<br>
<br>
Hamza has been a glimmer of hope.
<br>
<br>
Between so many celebrities who sell their souls,
<br>
<br>
Hamza has evolved throughout the years,
<br>
<br>
Never backing down and improving his craft.
<br>
<br>
Thanks to him, I've had my biggest realizations.
<br>
<br>
You must have this connection to your roots.
<br>
<br>
I went from watching his dopamine-filled videos while procrastinating and daydreaming,
<br>
<br>
To watching a two hour long full guide on willpower while working out.
<br>
<br>
I understood my purpose thanks to him,

<p> People talk about how Andrew Tate spreads misogyny.
<br>
<br>
If you are an independent thinker, you can easily see through the lies.
<br>
<br>
I watch the Tate brothers.
<br>
<br>
Am I a misogynist?
<br>
<br>
Absolutely not.
<br>
<br>
I respect women MORE since I've started watching the Tates.
<br>
<br>
Counter that.
<br>
<br>
In situations like this,
<br>
<br>
When men are rising up to inspire others,
<br>
<br>
It's not mainly about the person who is leading,
<br>
<br>
But what they stand for.
<br>
<br>
Every man is just a walking advertisement for his beliefs.
<br>
<br>
You can choose to believe whatever you want from every man you see.
<br>
<br>
Ideally, the thoughts you pick from these idols are useful ones.
<br>
<br>
If someone improves your life through words:
<br>
<br>
1. He is a great speaker and someone worth listening to.
<br>
<br>
2. He is a stepping stone for you to use in order to start that cycle of improvement.
<br>
<br>
Become a free thinker. </p>

<p> Has your mind ever been free?
<br>
<br>
I don't think so.
<br>
<br>
Your brain is clouded by unnecessary thoughts, urges and desires.
<br>
<br>
You need to open your mind in order to focus, and be fully present in your life.

Meditation is the key to that.

In this Godless and brainless society that we live in,

It's crucial to think for ourselves and not let the media indoctrinate us.

<p> The most dangerous trait a young man can possess is being articulate.
<br>
<br>
By being well-spoken, you can intimidate your enemies with powerful arguments.
<br>
<br>
Being defeated by words is humiliating.
<br>
<br>
It shows that you're incapable of holding your own ground.
<br>
<br>
Craft your words carefully.

<br>
And after all, what's your alternative?

Do you want to be inarticulate, and be unable to express your thoughts?
<br>
<br>
How is anyone going to take your ideas seriously if you can't communicate them?

Scheduling your day. Planning everything.

Additionally, I have come to understand how to build a good schedule.
<br>
<br>
Think of it as a building, with a soil that it's being built on, a foundation and a structure.
<br>
<br>
You already have either good habits or bad ones in your day,
<br>
<br>
So you can start building upon this foundation.
<br>
<br>
You can associate your already existing habits with ones you would like to implement.
<br>
<br>
This creates connection, and dependency,
<br>
<br>
Which will make it easier to stick to habits.
<br>
<br>
A good schedule should also be adaptable to unexpected situations.

<br>
Make it work regardless of anything. </p>

<p> I recently finished reading 12 Rules For Life by Jordan B. Peterson,
<br>
<br>
And it's been an enlightening experience.
<br>
<br>
Rule 8: Tell the truth ‚Äì or, at least, don't lie.
<br>
<br>
When in doubt, create no doubt with your sentences.
<br>
<br>
It's relieving to remain truthful during earnest situations.
<br>
<br>
The truth is very sustainable, because it's true.
<br>
<br>
Never be scared of what is true.
<br>
<br>
Be the pillar of reason and honesty.
<br>
<br>
And remember:
<br>
<br>
When cornered, never dig a hole in the wall.
<br>
<br>
This book is a hopeful one at that, it's truly your antidote to chaos.
<br>
<br>
Rule 1 says it all: Stand up straight with your shoulders back.
<br>
<br>
Confidence is needed when you want to become an advocate for honesty and honor.
<br>
<br>
Organize your life diligently and become a virtuous person. </p>

He who can fulfill this desire, will himself be the most important.

This feeling is tied to one's ego, so do not undermine anyone's pride,

<p> Here is a practical, step by step situation of how to engage in a conversation with others:
<br>
<br>
You walk into a room, walking confidently, greeting a couple of people, and most importantly, smiling.
<br>
<br>
Continue smiling as you approach them, and introduce yourself by stating your name.
<br>
<br>
If they also state their name, continue the conversation, if not, disengage: They aren't interested.
<br>
<br>
Start by complimenting them on something specific, that you can tell they care about:
<br>
<br>
Make them feel important.
<br>
<br>
Then, go on to talk about a topic involving them, ask them about it starting with their name: "So, Jake, what do you do for work?"
<br>
<br>
Expand on that topic by asking more questions and becoming a little interested in the other person.
<br>
<br>
From there, you just have to be a good listener, and make sure to be in a good mood so you can make them more comfortable with you.
<br>
<br>
If you start talking too much about yourself, almost bragging, that's never going to impress them. You just come off as arrogant and narcissistic.
<br>
<br>
Instead, you should talk in terms of their interests, because they'll be way more engaged if they care about the subject of the conversation.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, remember to make the interaction feel sincere, and don't force compliments. </p>

If you cannot successfully assess your actions, it's impossible to accept them.
<br>
<br>
Upon failure, the best move on the chess board isn't to dwell on the past,
<br>
<br>
But to reflect on what's occurred, contemplate "why?", and plan the next move.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, when you make a mistake, you have to hold full accountability.
<br>
<br>
You don't make bad choices because you're encompassed by bad habits,
<br>
<br>
You're encompassed by bad habits BECAUSE you make bad choices.
<br>
<br>
You can reflect on your mistakes through journaling. TAKE ACTION!
<br>
<br>
But don't get sucked into only seeing your defects.
<br>
<br>
You can also reflect on what you're doing right, and continue that.
<br>
<br>
Competing with other men can help you increase your standards for success,
<br>
<br>
And help you achieve more good, which you should also reflect upon and learn from. </p>

<p> Chess is the only game that you should play.

<br>
Everyone knows that video games are awful for you,

But I believe chess is different (being a board game), because it teaches a couple of life lessons:
<br>
<br>
Self accountability, the levels of a hierarchy and the multitude of roles.

Additionally, if you're struggling to quit video games,

Chess can satiate your need to play something,

Stories are a part of culture and history - so is life, a small part of the whole universe.

<p> I recently finished reading Beyond Order by Jordan B. Peterson, the sequel to 12 Rules For Life.
<br>
<br>
The first book enlightened me to the benefits of order,
<br>
<br>
This book showed me the malevolence that the world can offer.
<br>
<br>
It's quite a negative book, with a positive message behind it.
<br>
<br>
The duality of Professor Peterson's books is magnificent.
<br>
<br>
Rule XI: Do not allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, or arrogant.
<br>
<br>
Rule XII: Be grateful in spite of your suffering.
<br>
<br>
The definition of happiness regardless of understanding.
<br>
<br>
Ignorance is not necessary for joy.
<br>
<br>
Peterson teaches everyone how to navigate life in a simple manner,
<br>
<br>
While condemning the general advice of accepting weakness.
<br>
<br>
He shows you the alternative path, which is always an undesirable one,
<br>
<br>
And then he shows you who you could be if you followed better principles.
<br>
<br>
My favorite rule: Rule II: Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that
<br>
<br>
It teaches you about potential and the right way to reach it.
<br>
<br>
Concentration is the only thing that can guide you towards your ideal self.

You CAN become that person if you truly try to. </p>

<p> If you want respect as a man, you must set a frame for yourself.

<br>
A frame is a collection of virtues that you recognize as being important to you.
<br>
<br>
If you can't live by your own rules, no one's going to respect you.
<br>
<br>
You really have to understand what your core values are deep inside.
<br>
<br>
So, you have to ask yourself: "What are my virtues?"
<br>
<br>
It's an elementary question just like: "Who am I?" and "Who do I want to become?"
<br>
<br>
Answer it honestly and go very in-depth with your observations.
<br>
<br>
It helps to write it down on a piece of paper and meditate on this idea.
<br>
<br>
Thankfully for everyone, I already did this,
<br>
<br>
And came up with the H.H.H. system: (triple H system)
<br>
<br>
H.H.H: Honesty, Honor, Humility.
<br>
<br>
This is a very basic set of morals based on common sense.
<br>
<br>
1. Honesty
<br>
<br>
The truth is essential for efficient communication and building trust.
<br>
<br>
The truth is an easy way to never be caught up in a lie and ruin your reputation.
<br>
<br>
The whole truth can be used against you by your foes, so the partial truth will suffice.
<br>
<br>
Simply do not lie.
<br>
<br>
2. Honor
<br>
<br>
You need a good reputation, and that is built, not simply earned.
<br>
<br>
For this, you must be kind, but assertive with people you interact.
<br>
<br>
A true man has the power for malevolence, but chooses to be good.
<br>
<br>
First, you must respect yourself.
<br>
<br>
Simply be nice, but never weak.
<br>
<br>
3. Humility
<br>
<br>
When you reach a certain level of status, arrogance can quickly cloud your mind,
<br>
<br>
But arrogance, along with resentment and deceit, can quickly ruin your life.
<br>
<br>
You have to internally see yourself as a life-long student.
<br>

No one knows everything, so acknowledge that. </p>

Communication helps us, humans, to set our thoughts in order.

Sometimes, your mind is clouded by unorganized thoughts,

And conversating with others helps you organize those thoughts.

People think very differently, which makes each of us special.

New acquaintances provide spontaneous responses.

<p> A society has a level of looseness and a level of tightness.
<br>
<br>
A loose society is one that prioritizes change, is more lenient with its rules, and is generally quite equal.
<br>
<br>
A tight society is one that prioritizes culture and order, is more strict with its laws, and is more fair.
<br>
<br>
Ideally, a successful society should balance these two metrics.
<br>
<br>
Order and chaos should be maintained in a balanced duality.
<br>
<br>
Going too far in either extreme is problematic, whichever side is prioritized.
<br>
<br>
Hard times create tight societies, good times create loose societies.
<br>
<br>
1/ Loose societies reflect our contemporary world,
<br>
<br>
Where weak social bonds emerge due to trivial preoccupations.
<br>
<br>
Mild rules foster a sense of entitlement, allowing unrestricted behavior.
<br>
<br>
Ignoring tradition and misusing progressivism to hinder societal progress is commonplace.
<br>
<br>
2/ Tight societies are very traditional, resonating more with the past.
<br>
<br>
Being tight can stagnate the growth of a society if it's overdone,
<br>
<br>
Since everyone sticks to what they know.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, people have to step out of their comfort zone moderately.

Well, every philosophy or concept helps a certain group of people,

So I suggest you try adopting practices from both of them,
<br>
<br>
But what are they about?
<br>
<br>
Stoicism is negative thinking that has a positive scope.
<br>
<br>
Stoics do practices like: negative visualizations, last time meditation, and a view from above.
<br>
<br>
These practices are meant to make you acknowledge negativity.
<br>
<br>
Tragedy could strike at any time, so be grateful for today.
<br>
<br>
Stoicism makes you see your insignificance,
<br>
<br>
But then it also shows you that even the smallest of creatures have meaning.
<br>
<br>
It could be the last time you talk to those close to you,
<br>
<br>
So make it a memorable experience.
<br>
<br>
Negativity makes you appreciate positivity.
<br>
<br>
The Law Of Attraction is positive thinking that can remind you of negativity.
<br>
<br>
This philosophy includes practices like: manifestation and positive affirmation.
<br>
<br>
These practices are meant to make you feel better about yourself,
<br>
<br>
But also fake who you currently are to motivate you.
<br>
<br>
The Law Of Attraction is "fake it until you make it" while also accepting your situation.
<br>
<br>
Tell yourself that you are successful and fulfilled.
<br>
<br>
You must believe that you can truly do it. Be sure of your capabilities,
<br>
<br>
But positivity can blind you.

It's important to see yourself as a noble person,

<br>
But at the same, it can be beneficial to disregard the bad perceptions of others.

<br>
Every person sees you in a different way, yet they are all wrong.

<p> Do you belong where you fit in?
<br>
<br>
Everyone has their own social circle that they are a part of.
<br>
<br>
If you do not, you should, because humans thrive in groups,
<br>
<br>
But if you do, you understand the importance of feeling like you are part of a community.
<br>
<br>
Men especially need comrades.
<br>
<br>
But that desire to be someone and have a group surrounding you can spiral.
<br>
<br>
You could crave closeness so much to the point where you stop considering the quality of the people.
<br>
<br>
You might fit into a group because you're being inauthentic,
<br>
<br>
But you surely do not belong there.
<br>
<br>
Stop trying to fit in by changing yourself,
<br>
<br>
And start finding that sense of belonging,
<br>
<br>
By becoming the person that quality people would want to be around.
<br>
<br>
It's not worth sacrificing your goals, morals, and authenticity in order to hang out with losers.
<br>
<br>
Find a good tribe.
<br>
<br>
Most people have way more potential than they could fathom,
<br>
<br>
And reaching its peak would allow them to fulfill that desire for belonging.
<br>
<br>
You need to avoid wasting your precious time by simply fitting in,
<br>
<br>
And start chasing the life of the better you,
<br>
<br>
Who has the good tribe. </p>

<p> Who determines what is moral and immoral?
<br>
<br>
Depending on who you ask, you will also get a different answer.
<br>
<br>
Religious people will insist in the Bible's correctness and absolute covering of every situation.
<br>
<br>
Ideologues will argue the validity of their cult-like beliefs, and so on.
<br>
<br>
There are two types of morality: objective and subjective.
<br>
<br>
Objective morality is a consensus of our society that is often based on common sense.
<br>
<br>
Subjective morality is heavily based on personal experience and it usually deviates from the public's opinions.
<br>
<br>
Which is better?
<br>
<br>
Well, objective morality is the only one which is accepted in debates.
<br>
<br>
As humans, it's our nature to decide if things are right or wrong,
<br>
<br>
But realistically, we can never have the full context of a situation,
<br>
<br>
Even if we are part of it, because we can't read the minds of others.
<br>
<br>
So, it'd be impossible to increase the accuracy of our objective morality,
<br>
<br>
Since humans have wired sensors for these kinds of situations.
<br>
<br>
Murder will always be immoral, regardless of this fact's presence in writing.
<br>
<br>
Ironically, only subjective morality can skew common sense.
<br>
<br>
Though, subjective morality can quickly turn into an ethics battle.
<br>
<br>
Subjectivism is the belief that one's mental activity is the only relevant factor of experience.
<br>
<br>
So, there's no point in arguing with a subjectivist,
<br>
<br>
Even if they claim to be moral, since that's a mere label.
<br>
<br>
With subjective morality, the discussion can deviate from morality altogether,
<br>
<br>
Since situations can be wrong for different people for countless different reasons.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, people don't even know their beliefs on subjects,
<br>
<br>
Because they haven't consulted objectivity enough. </p>

Acknowledge that something's relevance is completely your choice.

You can choose to not be plagued by adversity,

Only through appropriate ignorance.

<p> Does time really solve everything?
<br>
<br>
Well, time by itself will never solve anything.
<br>
<br>
It is up to you to make the most of that time,
<br>
<br>
But what it does do is amplify your opportunities.
<br>
<br>
Also, time will provide clarity and numerous revelations,

Which will improve your decisions.
<br>
<br>
The short answer is that time solves nothing, since you do,
<br>
<br>
But this asset is your most valuable currency.
<br>
<br>
You must value your time,
<br>
<br>
Because it's during your time on this planet when you leave your mark.
<br>
<br>
What happens after death is irrelevant, if your time was well-spent.
<br>

Time is a weird concept,

Since the less of it you have, the more you want it,
<br>
<br>
And the more of it you have, the more you waste it.
<br>

<p> There is only one way to properly deal with stress.
<br>
<br>
Stress comes from stressful situations,
<br>
<br>
And through their name you can observe their nature: To be stressful.
<br>
<br>
To put it simply, you cannot avoid stress,
<br>
<br>
But you can stop it from affecting the quality of your living.
<br>
<br>
You have to acknowledge its existence, and move on.
<br>
<br>
The stress is there, and it will continue to be regardless of your reaction,
<br>
<br>
But not forever. It disappears after the situation is resolved,
<br>
<br>
So for the time being, avoid being stressed because of stress,
<br>
<br>
And live your life.
<br>
<br>
You have to move on, and one way to do this is through taking walks.
<br>
<br>
Your inner perception of your life might be skewed,
<br>
<br>
But the beauty of our world does not lie.
<br>
<br>
Try being present while taking these walks,
<br>
<br>
Kind of like meditation on the go,
<br>

And let go of the stress. </p>

<p> You've probably heard of the 3 communities in which men get categorized:
<br>
<br>
The redpill: Focused on self improvement and confidence.
<br>
<br>
The bluepill: Mostly about being nice and exaggerated progressivism.
<br>
<br>
The blackpill: Which is essentially nihilism with an obsession of statistics.
<br>
<br>
1. The redpill
<br>
<br>
This community is often associated with the successful, masculine role models.
<br>
<br>
It is a representation of being the ideal arrogant male,
<br>
<br>
Who might have fascinating life experience and reasons to be respected,
<br>
<br>
Yet sometimes acts as an overly-entitled pimp.
<br>
<br>
2. The bluepill
<br>
<br>
This community is filled with weak and submissive men,
<br>
<br>
Who are just incapable of getting attention without compromising their dignity.
<br>
<br>
Being kind and respectful is an ideal trait,
<br>
<br>
But you need to set boundaries,
<br>
<br>
And remain assertive and in-control of life.
<br>
<br>
3. The blackpill
<br>
<br>
Out of every community, this one is furthest from the answer to a fulfilling life.
<br>
<br>
Hopelessness is neither attractive, nor helpful in complex situations.
<br>
<br>
A positive out-look on life itself is necessary for success.
<br>
<br>
Their only valid point is being realistic.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, there is no single perfect, mystery set of beliefs.
<br>
<br>
You have to mix these pills, and achieve your own success.
<br>
<br>
A real man is a provider, who is caring, kind, and charitable,
<br>
<br>
Yet confident, ambitious, and assertive.

<p> Lust is worse than anger. In fact, worse than almost anything.
<br>
<br>
Lust is a constant state of longing for what you will never have,

<br>
<br>
Anger is characterized by spontaneous outbursts, which often quickly go away.

Lust is more a state of mind, while anger is a fleeting emotion.

All that remains when you die are your wise words.
<br>
<br>
Make them count,

<br>
And leave wisdom for your legacy to revisit.
<br>
<br>
Use your voice to stand for truth and honor.
<br>
<br>
Use your voice to inspire and save lives.
<br>
<br>
Use your voice to become known.

Talking is the essence of living happily. </p>

<p> This is a big reason why people want to become rich,
<br>
<br>
And this is also why people never succeed.
<br>
<br>
Because they want to live lavishly.
<br>
<br>
Because they want to spend large sums of money on status symbols, which are uselessly expensive.
<br>
<br>
Start using your money right for real wealth.
<br>
<br>
Firstly, you need to lower your need for validation.
<br>
<br>
No one cares about your bad monetary decisions, as in big purchases.
<br>
<br>
You must live normally and earn exceptionally.
<br>
<br>
You cannot live to please the view of others.
<br>
<br>
This is at least until you achieve long-term extreme wealth.
<br>
<br>
Secondly, you need to think about money differently.
<br>
<br>
Most people spend first, and then they invest the rest.
<br>
<br>
Wrong. First invest as much as you can, then live off the rest.
<br>
<br>
Your current living conditions shouldn't be comfortable,
<br>
<br>
As they will improve from investing properly. </p>

You are simply paying for their ability to filter your thoughts.
<br>

There is nothing special about therapists and coaches.
<br>
<br>
You already know more about yourself.
<br>
<br>
The best practice you could do for self-discovery is journaling.
<br>

Writing will filter out your unnecessary thoughts, and leave you with answers,

Especially if you overthink a lot.

Do your own introspection.

You will get all of the rewards with no cost.

<p> As humans we must understand human nature.
<br>
<br>
Not only to understand others, but ourselves as well.
<br>
<br>
There is a duality, a twoness, to understanding yourself and others. Separate things,
<br>
<br>
Yet, they are intertwined, which means that analyzing any sort of human behavior will help.
<br>
<br>
Any individual understands themselves more than others,
<br>
<br>
Therefore, our shadow self is more clear to us than anyone's.
<br>
<br>
Our darkness is the most paramount to us,
<br>
<br>
Since it's the only one we can understand.
<br>
<br>
Still, many people don't, and not knowing yourself is disadvantageous.
<br>
<br>
I believe your shadow self is simply a representation of malevolence,
<br>
<br>
Therefore, it has quite a low level of nobility which it caters to.
<br>
<br>
Yet, it's more powerful than your other half, your higher, rational self.
<br>
<br>
It's way easier to desire destruction than it is the opposite.
<br>
<br>
What you need to do is analyze your behavior.
<br>
<br>
When do you feel a certain way, and how does that affect your actions?
<br>
<br>
You can discover and reduce your negative patterns that way,
<br>
<br>
Since humans are prone to irrationality,
<br>
<br>
And our lower self which wants pleasure is stronger. </p>

<p> Being like water is a fascinating philosophy.
<br>
<br>
Martial artist, yet philosopher, Bruce Lee said:
<br>
<br>
"Be water, my friend" - promoting resilience and formlessness.
<br>
<br>
But, the Taoist philosophy also reinforces this idea:
<br>
<br>
Nothing competes with water's ability to overcome the rigid.
<br>
<br>
The basic understanding of this concept resorts to the benefits of weakness.
<br>
<br>
Compromising on assertiveness can improve your ability to change and adapt.
<br>
<br>
Life is spontaneous in nature, since chaos is part of it,
<br>
<br>
Therefore, it's useful to not remain in a fixed pattern.
<br>
<br>
My interpretation of this philosophy goes a step further than mere adaptability.
<br>
<br>
Water flows regardless, and it flows calmly, yet when disrupted it becomes dangerous.
<br>
<br>
People easily drown, regardless of how malleable water is.
<br>
<br>
Thus, you must be peaceful, but capable of harm.
<br>
<br>
If you think about it, water is the essence of surviving.
<br>
<br>
It is more essential than most things, so it has leverage over us.
<br>
<br>
Everybody treasures water, to the point where a philosophy is telling is to imitate it.
<br>
<br>
Be like water: malleable and free, dangerous, essential. </p>

<p> People underestimate how useful flow states are.
<br>
<br>
Flow states are those periods of time where you have no thoughts which aren't about your current work.
<br>
<br>
They are states of mind in which your productivity is prioritized,
<br>
<br>
Since your brain must only have one task at hand.
<br>
<br>
Flow states are very hard to enter when you're doing activities which don't matter.
<br>
<br>
You have to find your flow state activity.
<br>
<br>
This activity will be your main source of income if you play your cards right,
<br>
<br>
But it won't feel like work, because it's also enjoyable to you.
<br>
<br>
I'm not telling you to focus on passion, but on mastery.
<br>
<br>
Find the task that you were born to master,
<br>
<br>
And become the best at it.
<br>
<br>
You do your best work when you're incentivized by your natural talent to continue.
<br>
<br>
Everyone has a flow activity,
<br>
<br>
And discovering it will free you.
<br>
<br>
You will never waste time and energy if you work on the right thing.
<br>
<br>
It will be your initiative and motivation to work hard,
<br>
<br>
Because it's your purpose in life to know more about this activity.
<br>
<br>
Focusing will become easier if you remove distractions,
<br>
<br>
And enter a flow state. </p>

The black swan theory is a prime example of this.

it's a metaphor that describes an event that comes unexpectedly and has a major effect.

But it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

<br>
People can use dark tricks to manipulate you,
<br>
<br>
But you can have access to these psychological tricks as well...
<br>
<br>
Here are 3 of the best dark psychological tricks straight from the infamous 48 Laws Of Power:
<br>
<br>
Law #12: Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm Your Victim.
<br>
<br>
Once you gain one's trust once, it'll be easy to keep abusing it,
<br>
<br>
Because they won't want to recognize their mistake,
<br>
<br>
But also since it's hard to replace such bonds.
<br>
<br>
All it takes is one act of selflessness.
<br>
<br>
Law #46: Never Appear Too Perfect.
<br>
<br>
If you think undisturbed greatness will create unlimited respect, you're wrong.
<br>
<br>
It will create silent, envious enemies.
<br>
<br>
If they feel too inferior, you will never tame their rebellion.
<br>
<br>
Make intentional yet small mistakes to disarm them.
<br>
<br>
Law #32: Play to People's Fantasies.
<br>
<br>
The truth comes with disheartening realizations,
<br>
<br>
Which is why it's often ignored in favor of one's delusional fantasies.
<br>
<br>
These people face rejection from almost everyone,
<br>
<br>
So if you can be the one who encourages them,
<br>
<br>
You can control them. </p>

Otherwise, you will get demolished by those who do everything they can to succeed.

<br>
<br>

<p> Evolve, one thought at a time.
<br>
<br>
That's my motto.
<br>
<br>
What does it mean?
<br>
<br>
It's a phrase that encapsulates everything I stand for.
<br>
<br>
Understanding it will help you develop yourself properly.
<br>
<br>
So, let me explain.
<br>
<br>
In life, you mustn't change, but evolve.
<br>
<br>
Changing is a word with negative connotations when using it to refer to people.
<br>
<br>
People are scared of change, because it symbolizes potential chaos.
<br>
<br>
But, you must evolve as a person.
<br>
<br>
You cannot stay tied down to your past self.
<br>
<br>
And, you must go through this evolution by thinking.
<br>
<br>
Even ONE thought could change your whole perspective,
<br>
<br>
Thus, pushing you further to becoming your best self.
<br>
<br>
When wanting to take decisions, you think.
<br>
<br>
When wanting to discover something, you think.
<br>
<br>
It's all about thinking.
<br>
<br>
But, you must do it one at a time.
<br>
<br>
You cannot rush evolution, let alone "change" as they say.
<br>
<br>
Everything in life is gradual.
<br>
<br>
You must take it slow, and learn along the way.
<br>
<br>
Patience is the trait you need for success,
<br>
<br>
Yet, it is the trait no one seems to desire anymore. </p>

<p> Fame will change your life so much, you might want to reconsider even desiring it.
<br>
<br>
No famous person praises their recognition, they all want to go back in time.
<br>
<br>
It's because fame eats a part of your soul.
<br>
<br>
You cannot keep your mind pure if you want to keep your fame.
<br>

Every person who desires to reach the top has a dream,

Until they men in black suits show up and explain how the world really works.

Famous people might have good intentions,

But the industry does not stand for truth.
<br>
<br>
Thus, every famous person must be controlled.
<br>
<br>
The noble thing to do would be to go back to your roots, your core morals,
<br>
<br>
And stick by and promote your actual beliefs.
<br>
<br>
Do not become just another puppet.
<br>
<br>
Fame will ruin you without your consent.
<br>

The type of person you should aspire to be is the silent millionaire.
<br>
<br>
When you see people changing after becoming a staple in the industry,
<br>
<br>
It means that they gave up on THEIR self, only for fame.
<br>
<br>
Do not resent them, as they are not bad people,
<br>
<br>
But they just stand for bad things.
<br>

Never worship celebrities, as they are replacements for God. </p>

<p> Humanity has created numerous ways of communication voluntarily,
<br>
<br>
Hence we have so many languages, for almost every nation.
<br>
<br>
But there is one more language, that we all know, inside of us, but it's just buried,
<br>
<br>
And that is body language, especially the ability to read it.
<br>
<br>
We all speak this peculiar language,
<br>
<br>
Yet we do not even notice it, since it has become an instinct.
<br>
<br>
Back in our prehistoric days we had to communicate somehow,
<br>
<br>
So we picked up this indirect way of communication.
<br>
<br>
Even as children, it is all we had available for communication.
<br>
<br>
As with most things, learning body language is a skill,
<br>
<br>
But it is one which will have immense benefits to learning.
<br>
<br>
You will be able to not only understand the true motives of others,
<br>
<br>
But also understand how you feel, and thus act, in situations.
<br>
<br>
It is a skill of observation.
<br>
<br>
All you have to do is keep trying to observe it.
<br>
<br>
Don't pay attention only to a person's speech,
<br>
<br>
But to their facial expression, tone of voice and even breathing patterns.
<br>
<br>
You can't mask body language, as you can with speech,
<br>
<br>
So you'll be able to see someone's true intentions.
<br>
<br>
This is also a skill based on removing your self-absorption,
<br>
<br>
Which is something that keeps developing as time passes.
<br>
<br>
You must truly become attentive to what other people are doing,
<br>
<br>
Instead of focusing on what you are going to say.
<br>
<br>
Start speaking less, and observing more.
<br>
<br>
Also, begin by analyzing only one person,
<br>
<br>
And trying to find patterns, so you can accurately portray said individual.
<br>
<br>
Try to see behind the mask that everyone puts on for you.
<br>
<br>
Use their real thoughts not only to control them,
<br>
<br>
But to keep yourself far from dangerous people. </p>

<p> I've been pondering the meaning of life, the most fundamental question.
<br>
<br>
What is a person's divine purpose, if there is one, and how does one find it?
<br>
<br>
Everyone has their own meaning of life,
<br>
<br>
But could we come to a consensus?
<br>
<br>
Life cannot be ultimately meaningless.
<br>
<br>
There is a possibility that us humans invent divinity,
<br>
<br>
Only to cope with the mystery of the universe and our existence,
<br>
<br>
Then we find purpose in this.
<br>
<br>
Was there always a universe, and if so, how?
<br>
<br>
Was there a point in time when the universe simply appeared, and if so, how?
<br>
<br>
Our best option would be to not delude ourselves into meaningfulness.
<br>
<br>
The world could act meaninglessly sometimes; not everything has an answer.
<br>
<br>
Thus, it would be absurd to always search for inexistent explanations.
<br>
<br>
Stop explaining the world, and start exploring yourself.
<br>
<br>
We all live in the same objective reality, however unexplainable it is,
<br>
<br>
Yet our meaning of life is completely subjective.
<br>
<br>
Our purpose is a direct product of our perception of life.
<br>
<br>
We have to perceive the world as accurately as possible,
<br>
<br>
Then maybe we could reason with life. </p>

Whenever you take some time off, which should be as rare as possible,
<br>
<br>
Make sure to work in advance, so you still stay ahead of responsibilities.
<br>
<br>
If you genuinely like the work you do, as you should,
<br>
<br>
Then burnout is not a possibility.
<br>
<br>
Just make sure to never put work off.
<br>
<br>
What you choose to do for financial gain will influence your life immensely.
<br>
<br>
Your work is both your legacy, and half of your life,
<br>
<br>
So make sure to make it meaningful.
<br>
<br>
If your mind constantly thinks of work, you naturally have that fire inside of you,
<br>
<br>
And it will get you far. </p>

<p> It should be common knowledge that people react better to praise, than to criticism.
<br>
<br>
No one likes to be put down for what they have done wrong,
<br>
<br>
But everybody loves being acknowledged for their achievements,
<br>
<br>
So why not use this information to motivate and persuade people?
<br>
<br>
There's been a clear rise in the masculine mindset,
<br>
<br>
Which encourages criticism amongst men,
<br>
<br>
Since it is a more direct way to incentivize improvement.
<br>
<br>
But, for most people, a person who knows how to make them feel praiseworthy is more needed.
<br>
<br>
We must know this to help others.
<br>
<br>
Firstly, criticism makes people defensive, causing them cling to their ways.
<br>
<br>
Secondly, praise will encourage them to do more of the good habits,
<br>
<br>
Because they crave that external validation from you.
<br>
<br>
Also, mockery might encourage coping with criticism through more indulgence.
<br>
<br>
In the end, you just need to understand the person you are talking to,
<br>
<br>
So you can appropriately handle their self-destruction.
<br>
<br>
Good people do everything they can to keep their friends on the right path.
<br>
<br>
But, as a universal rule, praise will always be better. </p>
