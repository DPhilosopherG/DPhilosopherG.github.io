<h1>The Philosophy Of Individuality</h1>
    <p>Unraveling Authenticity: A Philosophical Journey into Individuality</p>

       <p> Individuality in our modern world
<br>
 <br>
When you think about people and society as a whole, you just see the faces of those surrounding you. Anything behind their facial features is hidden until further acknowledgement of that person, as more than a person, who is just part of the bigger picture - the crowd - but as an individual.
<br>
 <br>
  If you analyze this existence, it quickly becomes a sad reality. We as human beings, are social creatures, and taking that aspect away from us - replacing it with just the mere presence of other humans - is depressing. Unfortunately, the environment in which most of us live is one of monotony and a lack of genuine human connection - That is a somewhat accurate depiction of the modern world.</p>

         <p>Developing your individuality
<br>
 <br>
   The chances of living a fulfilled existence drastically decrease when you are surrounded by the by-products of this modern world, as you would imagine. So, the one thing I would recommend to people that are able to relate deeply to such a description, is to develop their individuality - which in turn will attract more individuals, that will be able to fulfill your need for quality acquaintances.
<br>
 <br>
 Individuality is exclusive to beings with the ability to develop their critical thinking abilities - and, unlike animals, we humans are, or could be, great at becoming independent intellectuals. We could be, because most of us are easily and quite efficiently influenced by others, who are unqualified to judge someone else. That influence servers as a barrier to who you could really become - a person that accurately represents how you feel inside. In actuality, this pursuit towards individuality is a desperate attempt at synchronizing your physical and metaphysical attributes - in a way that also suits what is beneficial for your future.</p>

         <p>Living an inauthentic life
<br>
 <br>
   By aligning our actions with our core values, we can become more complete. In the same way, most of the time, the pursuit of happiness is nothing but the expression of a confused soul. What you genuinely crave is a feeling of authenticity and uniqueness: that is individuality.
<br>
 <br>
   You should be terrified of living a life of inauthenticity. Imagine this scenario: You are born as a perfectly healthy, soon-to-be complex individual. Yet somehow, that potential slowly gets beaten out of you - not literally, but I believe the fact that it is not meant literally is even more disappointing, because you can surely overcome some slight physical maltreatment, while on the other hand, living with a weak mindset is exponentially worse. Regardless, that is what happens in this hypothetical scenario - you get destroyed mentally by social media, fake friends, and parents that are not exactly equipped with the knowledge necessary to raise an independent thinker, in the sense that your most precious asset - your mind - gets influenced and changed, becoming weaker as a result. You go through life in this inhumane way, while attracting more people that positively reinforce your bad habits, until you die.</p>

         <p>Gathering individuality online
<br>
 <br>
   To combat that faith, you might consider turning to others who are not necessarily part of your circle in the real world. I am of course referring to consuming content on the internet. In the same way, that if you spend too much time with a certain type of person, you become more like that type, without realizing, the one undoubtedly good thing that the modern world offers you is the ability to mentally consume the thoughts of the brightest minds on planet Earth. When you consume the content of such intellectuals, you are getting exclusive insights into how their mind works, and how their thoughts are formed. Even if it does not appear like it, one of the most effective ways to become more of an individual is to surround yourself with the best of individuals.
<br>
 <br>
   The alternative to using that method is simply living a life where your thoughts are not actually yours. Imagine this: It would be terrifying for someone to have the ability to read your thoughts, right? Well now they do not have to, because they literally posses the same thoughts as you. What you have just read is a basic explanation of the herd mentality - Arguably the one and only reason for this deep desire for individuality.</p>
