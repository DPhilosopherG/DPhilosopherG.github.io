<h1>How To Master Reality</h1>
    <p>- And dealing with the multitude of fake realities.</p>
    <img src="Articles/ArtBanner3.jpg">
         
         <p>The two types of realities:
<br>
 <br>
1) The objective reality
<br>
 <br>
The first type is the reality that actively surrounds us during our day-to-day endeavors. This is often the one crucial argument that logic-oriented individuals leverage in arguments and the general explanation of our complex universe.
<br>
 <br>
This type of reality is somewhat of a base for all philosophy, being the foundation for any sort of research-based facts.
<br>
 <br>
2) Our personal perception of reality
<br>
 <br>
The second type is the reality that everyone uses as a personal justification for every portion of their being. It is a relatively controversial topic nowadays because of the unjust usage of such a powerful tool of the human psyche - also named “perception”.
<br>
 <br>
A lot of people in our society think that their perception effectively trumps the importance of factual existence - a statement that is obviously reserved for a certain kind of delusional individual.</p>
          <img src="files/PostDivider.png">
         <p>Which reality is objectively of grander import?
<br>
 <br>
Both of these types of realities are useful - each in a very unique way - but also slightly overlapping in terms of import.
<br>
 <br>
It is important to remain meek when referring to - and consistently using - your own perception as an enabler for arguments, because very rarely are your own subjective feelings good bases for your rationales in regard to how our world functions.
<br>
 <br>
On the other hand, I could only come up with one simple reason for why objective reality might not efficiently apply to every situation without fail: And that is because of exceptions. These ununiform situations become significant issues when discussing and debating complicated subjects such as this one, because one of the grand attributes of human nature is the lack of uniformity.
<br>
 <br>
So, with all of this discussed, which is of greater import? Well, Both have their specific uses, Thus there is not an objectively better type of reality, and it would be irrelevant to debate this. Ultimately what is more important is knowing how to advantageously profit from both.</p>
         <img src="files/PostDivider.png">
         <p>How do you use objective reality and perception to your advantage?
<br>
 <br>
#1 - You should use objective reality as a way to remain fairly down-to-earth, and always have a basic grasp of reality in your back pocket if all else fails miserably. One of the biggest advantages of objective reality is its certainty and simplicity to understand because of the mere fact that it is a direct by-product of your own sights. Your eyes cannot consciously lie after all.
<br>
 <br>
#2 - You ought to use perception with utter cautiousness, because it can quickly become a slippery slope directly heading you towards an abyss called “delusion”. We see this happening in modern society more than it should because the glorification of one’s feelings</p>
         <hr class="smallhr">
         <p>!!! If you were to only learn one thing from this post it should be the following: Perception can and should be used to eliminate trivial distractions through means of seeing yourself superior to a mediocre life or by removing metaphysical barriers from your path to success. !!!</p>
          <hr class="smallhr">
          <img src="files/PostDivider.png">
         <p>What are fake realities and how do you avoid them?
<br>
 <br>
Fake realities are ultimately just the use of perception with subconscious malevolent intentions hiding deep inside the dark of your mind.
<br>
 <br>
We discussed that perception is useful when trying to develop your mind, especially because of the ability to use a “fake it ‘till you make it” mindset, but your subjective view of reality becomes dangerous to you when you unwillingly subdue to the lies and deceptive practices of your own mind. Meaning that you ignore objective reality when discussing factual matters.
<br>
 <br>
To avoid fake realities means to stay clear of giving too much power to your subjective perceptions - a practice that often leads to skewed views of the world and which most likely keeps you a slave to our modern world. Perception can just as well be used to limit your mental confidence by setting boundaries on your successes, which is why it’s specifically important to hold powerful beliefs.</p>
